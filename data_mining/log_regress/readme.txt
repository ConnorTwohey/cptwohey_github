To run the program, enter the following in the terminal:
"python log_regress.py"

I have included the original assignment prompt corresponding to the program.

This program is my attempt at implementing a perceptron for logistic regression, using gradient descent and cross entropy. The assignment asked for ROC curves and accuracy values, which I was unable to provide. I am also unsure about the correctness of my gradient descent function or my objective/cross entropy function. However, I do have implementations for the link function (logit), as well as prediction and sigmoid functions.
