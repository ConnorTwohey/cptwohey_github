No IDE was used for these programs, just a text editor.
No additional packages needed.

The original assignment prompt is included. The programs are meant to meet all specifications given in the original assignment document.

It is recommended that client.py and server.py are kept in separate folders so no conflicts between the two programs arise.
To set the host, go to line 12 in server.py and set the HOST value to the desired IP address.

To run the server:
python server.py <port>

To run the client:
python client.py <host_ip> <port> <filename>

If the programs are being run on UTAs network, the selected port must be 8080.
However, for most other networks, all of the open TCP ports are allowed.
