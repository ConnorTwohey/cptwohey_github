This program was written using Python 2.7.10.

This program assumes that the provided graph will be completely connected, and that
a path will always exist between any two nodes.

I have included the original assignment prompt with the program. It lists the  specifications that are met by my programs.

IMPORTANT: If running the program on a Windows machine, see the comment on line 9

No additional libraries or packages are needed to run the program.
Simply run it from the command line/terminal: python dijkstra.py

Commands (Enter when prompted by program):
	To list all paths: list_all_paths
	To list path from given source to given destination: list_path_to <src> <dest>

The format of outputted paths is the same as specified in the lab document.
